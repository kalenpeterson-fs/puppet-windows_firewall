Remarks:

      - Sets a new parameter value on an identified rule. The command fails
        if the rule does not exist. To create a rule, use the add command.
      - Values after the new keyword are updated in the rule.  If there are
        no values, or keyword new is missing, no changes are made.
      - A group of rules can only be enabled or disabled.
      - If multiple rules match the criteria, all matching rules will
        be updated.
      - Rule name should be unique and cannot be "all".
      - If a remote computer or user group is specified, security must be
        authenticate, authenc or authdynenc.
      - Setting security to authdynenc allows systems to dynamically
        negotiate the use of encryption for traffic that matches
        a given Windows Firewall rule. Encryption is negotiated based on
        existing connection security rule properties. This option
        enables the ability of a machine to accept the first TCP
        or UDP packet of an inbound IPsec connection as long as
        it is secured, but not encrypted, using IPsec.
        Once the first packet is processed, the server will
        re-negotiate the connection and upgrade it so that
        all subsequent communications are fully encrypted.
      - Authdynenc is valid only when dir=in.
      - If action=bypass, the remote computer group must be specified when dir=i
n.
      - If service=any, the rule applies only to services.
      - ICMP type or code can be "any".
      - Edge can only be specified for inbound rules.

Examples:

      Change the remote IP address on a rule called "allow80":
      netsh advfirewall firewall set rule name="allow80" new
      remoteip=192.168.0.2

      Enable a group with grouping string "Remote Desktop":
      netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group="remote desktop" new
      enable=yes

      Change the localports on the rule "Allow port range" for udp-
      Set rule name="Allow port range" dir=out protocol=udp localport=5000-5020
action=allow
